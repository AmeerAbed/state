* [Stack Overflow](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/150120/definition-of-state)

### Objects & Arrays

* [Reference vs. Value (Mosh video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD0t_DKREbE)
* [Reference vs. Value (CodeBurst article)](https://codeburst.io/javascript-passing-by-value-vs-reference-explained-in-plain-english-8d00fd06a47c)

### DOM Manipulation

### Sunday Lesson Plan

Study the [Sunday lesson plan](https://hackyourfuture.be/state/week-1) so you come prepared. It's not possible to learn everything in 4 hours, the more prepared you are the more you will benefit from class!

## Assignments

Starting with the exercises will make it easier to complete the project.  Spending a few days practicing before diving into the project will be worth it.

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* Continue the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises
  * Sign into FreeCodeCamp using your GitHub Account
  * Turn on your Public Profile
  * Complete [Basic Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/)
  * Begin [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/)
* Fork [JS Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/)
  * Solve the Exercises in the folders called `week-3`, and `week-3-practice`.
  * You will need to run these exercises [in Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY), but don't be intimidated!  This is actually a very simple way to run your code.  With a little practice using `cd` and `ls` from the command line you'll be good to go!
  * VSC comes built-in with a very good [JavaScript debugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY) that will help you to step through your code and understand what is happening inside your program.  At first this will be a bit intimidating, but soon you'll wonder how you ever programmed without it.

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Fork [dom-manipulation](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/dom-manipulation)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* Fork [listeners-and-handlers](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/listeners-and-handlers)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* Fork [handler-refactors](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/handler-refactors)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!

#### Challenge Exercises

* (_Isolate_) Fork [js-exercises-tdd](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises-tdd)
* (_Isolate_) Fork [javascript-exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises)
* (_Integrate_) Fork [javascript-you__dom-exercises](https://github.com/omahacodeschool/javascript-toy__dom-exercises)

### Project

__Biggest & Smallest__

> [Starter Code](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to create a small application that allows a user to interact with data saved in your website. Your goal should be to learn how to incrementally develop, log and debug your project.  Don't worry so much about making pretty or making quick progress, a finished app is not the goal! To get started [fork this repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/biggest-and-smallest), clone it and open the code in VSC.  Here are some tips:

* Go back and forth between VSC and your browser very often.  Every time you make a change in the code, refresh in the browser to test your code and check for any errors.
* Always have your Debugger open.  Take the time to step through each time you program pauses.
* Check the `log` very often!  It's kind of like the debugger, but for your application.  The Debugger allows you to watch memory change in a single function, the `log` lets you see memory change over time in your whole project.

Besides passing the tests, this week you should spend plenty of time practicing [stepping through in the debugger](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome).  The starter code has `debugger` statements already in place to pause your website whenever an event occurs. It might feel a bit slow, but do take the time to step through the test cases and user interactions. Tracing execution like this will help you to understand working with arrays & objects, how functions work, and how the logic of your solution works.  You should especially step through your code _before_ you have passed the tests!  The debugger is there to help you understand what your code _does_ do (instead of what you _want_ it to do) and to find your mistakes.

Your completed project repository must contain:

1. A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
1. One branch for each step of your development, as practiced in class.
1. A live demo with: 0 failing asserts, 5 working buttons
